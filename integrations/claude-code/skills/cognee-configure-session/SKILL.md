description: Switch which Cognee session this terminal uses. Lists existing sessions and lets the user pick one (or enter a session id), then routes the rest of the conversation's memory into that session.

# Switch the active Cognee session

Use this when the user wants to see, choose, or switch the Cognee memory session
the current terminal writes to and recalls from (e.g. "switch session", "resume a
past session", "what sessions exist", "/cognee-configure-session").

## Steps

1. **List sessions.** Run:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cognee-session-list.py"
   ```
   This prints JSON: `{ "current": "<current session id>", "total": N,
   "sessions": [ { "session_id", "last_activity_at", "status", "last_model" }, ... ] }`
   (most-recent first).

2. **Show the user the options.** Render a short, readable list of the sessions
   (id + last activity + status), and clearly mark which one is `current`.

3. **Ask the user to pick — interactively.** Call the `AskUserQuestion` tool with
   the **2–3 most recently used** sessions (excluding the current one) as options.
   `AskUserQuestion` automatically provides an **"Other"** choice, which the user
   can use to type any session id (e.g. an older one not shown, or a brand-new
   name to start fresh). Label each option with the session id and its last
   activity so it's recognizable.

4. **Apply the pick.** Run, with the chosen (or typed) session id:
   ```bash
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/cognee-session-set.py" "<chosen-session-id>"
   ```
   It prints `{ "ok": true, "old_session", "new_session", "synced_previous" }`.

5. **Confirm.** Tell the user the active session is now `<new_session>`. If
   `synced_previous` is true, mention the previous session's memory was flushed to
   the graph. From the next message on, recall and saving happen in the new
   session — no restart needed.

## Notes

- The switch affects **only this terminal**. Other running agents keep their own
  sessions. Two terminals can deliberately pick the *same* session id to share one.
- If the user just wants to *see* the current session and count, that's the status
  line (`🧠 <session> (+N more)`) — but you can also answer from step 1's output.
- If `cognee-session-set.py` returns `ok: false` with "could not determine current
  launch", the picker couldn't identify this terminal; report that rather than
  guessing.
